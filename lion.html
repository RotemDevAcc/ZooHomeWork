        <h1>The Lion</h1>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the Felidae family.
            Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are iconic and majestic animals that are widely recognized and
            admired for their strength, beauty, and social behavior.</p>
        <img src="images/lion.jpeg" alt="Lion" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>Lions are native to various regions in Africa and some parts of India. They are characterized by their
            muscular build, a distinctive mane around the neck of adult males, and a tawny coat with a white
            underbelly.</p>
        <p>Lions are highly social animals, often living in groups known as prides. Prides consist of related lionesses
            and their cubs, along with a few adult males. The females are responsible for hunting, while the males
            protect the pride's territory.</p>
        <img src="images/lion_family.jpeg" alt="Lion Family" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>Lions are carnivores and primarily hunt large ungulates such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo. They are
            known for their teamwork when hunting, which involves strategic coordination to bring down their prey.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, lions are classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of
            Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflicts, and poaching. Conservation efforts are crucial
            to protect these magnificent animals and preserve their natural habitats.</p>
